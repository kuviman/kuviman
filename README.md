# Hi I'm kuviman

I like participating in game jams, you can see my games on [itch.io](https://kuviman.itch.io).
I use Rust ðŸ¦€ and my own [game engine](https://github.com/geng-engine/geng)

I also stream sometimes. You can see me on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/kuviman).

Current projects:

- [Linksider - a puzzle game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995150/Linksider)
- [Kast - an experimental programming language](https://kast-lang.org)

I use NixOS btw.
